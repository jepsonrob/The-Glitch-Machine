# The-Glitch-Machine
A Generative Loop-Mangling Audio Tool

The Glitch Machine is an open-source generative sample-mangling environment developed in Max/MSP. The Machine quantizes playback effects, plugins and in-built audio effects creating potentially billions of loop variations: subtle or drastic.

The end-user is able to determine the chance of an effect triggering and automatically create billions of varieties of loops from just one audio source, without losing control over the system.

Current feautres include sequencers and MIDI functionality to give the end-user even more control, but these are currently experimental! The final design is intended as a standalone environment with four playback systems performing simultaneously, samples able to be hot-swapped.
